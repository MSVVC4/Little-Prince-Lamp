## Hi everyone

This is my first github public project.

One day, I received a night light in the shape of a ball that glowed a single static color. I wanted to make it more interesting, so I modified it by replacing the LEDs with an addressable strip and connecting it to an esp32. Now the night light can change its color depending on the weather, time of day, and temperature. It also includes simple weather-related animations, such as breathing for clouds or flashes for thunderstorms. This repository contains the code for the server part that calculates the weather-related color, and for the esp32, which controls the LEDs and animations.
